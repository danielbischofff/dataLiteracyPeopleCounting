# Analyzing Visitor Patterns at Mensa Shedhalle from Public Network Activity
## Abstract
Is it possible to know how crowded the mensa is and how long the queues are? Is there a regular pattern of visitor and is it possible to answer this question based on network activity? For investigating this questions network data was tracked during a regular working week. 
We estimate the total number of people having lunch using public WiFi traffic and use it to model queue waiting times. Through this, we reveal the optimal times for visiting the canteen and the advantages and limitations of single-sensor tracking via open-source software.The current paper shows how tracking public WiFi is privately possible and how the resulting data is useful for producing an estimate for human traffic flow in public spaces.
