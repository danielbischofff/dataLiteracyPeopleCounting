I read on Mac Address Randomization, here are the news:

Apple devices change their random address they have for a specific connection to a hotspot at most once/24h (source:https://www.extremenetworks.com/resources/blogs/wi-fi-mac-randomization-privacy-and-collateral-damage)
Windows devices are the same (1/24 h) (source: https://www.guidingtech.com/what-is-mac-randomization-and-how-to-use-it-on-your-devices/)
Android: also every 24 h (https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/wifi-mac-randomization-behavior)
